This is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms, currently implemented in TypeScript. It is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

The main purpose of this repository is to help me learn and understand the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. I hope it will also help others who are interested in learning about them.

## Data Structures

- [Dynamic Array](./src/data-structures/dynamic-array/README.md)
- [Linked List](./src/data-structures/linked-list/README.md)
- [Stack](./src/data-structures/stack/README.md)
- [Queue](./src/data-structures/queue/README.md)

## Algorithms

### Sorting

- [Selection Sort](./src/algorithms/sorting/selection-sort/README.md)
- [Insertion Sort](./src/algorithms/sorting/insertion-sort/README.md)
- [Merge Sort](./src/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/README.md)
- [Quick Sort](./src/algorithms/sorting/quick-sort/README.md)

### Shuffling

- [Fisher-Yates Shuffle](./src/algorithms/shuffling/fisher-yates/README.md)

## Tests

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
